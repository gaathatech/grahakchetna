      "description": "India\u2019s emergence as a global digital power now hinges on its ability to build artificial intelligence systems that are indigenous, inclusive, and aligned with national priorities. As AI increasingly shapes governance, public services, industry, and citizen engagement, the need for homegrown foundational models has become important. These models must be trained on Indian languages, local data, and real-world contexts to ensure relevance and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nBuilt with the vision of creating AI systems specifically for India, Sarvam AI is an organization that is developing artificial intelligence tailored to India\u2019s needs by building foundational components and applying them to the country\u2019s unique linguistic, enterprise, and governance requirements. The company has built a full-stack AI platform, with everything developed, deployed, and governed entirely in India. These enterprise grade platforms reflect the country\u2019s linguistic diversity and are designed to support public service delivery. Its work directly addresses long-standing barriers in accessibility, multilingual communication, and dependence on foreign AI infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAt the India AI Impact Summit 2026, Union Minister Shri Amit Shah stated that Sarvam AI exemplifies why the future belongs to India. He noted that the company is ensuring technology reaches every citizen, advancing the vision of Viksit Bharat, where innovation serves as a trusted ally in empowering people and strengthening the nation.\r\n\r\nDriving Digital Self-Reliance through Indigenous AI Models\r\n\r\nStrengthening indigenous AI infrastructure is central to India\u2019s vision of technological sovereignty, digital self-reliance, and inclusive growth. In an era where artificial intelligence shapes governance, economic competitiveness, and citizen services, building AI systems rooted in local languages, datasets, and regulatory frameworks ensures that innovation aligns with national priorities and societal needs. Indigenous AI development not only safeguards strategic autonomy but also fosters economic resilience and equitable access to emerging technologies.\r\n\r\nIn this context, Sarvam AI stands out as one of the 12 organisations selected under the Innovation Centre pillar of the IndiaAI Mission to develop indigenous foundational models, with financial and compute support amounting to \u20b9246.72 crore. The company is building large language and speech models (LLMs) tailored for Indian languages and public service delivery, with capabilities such as voice-based interfaces, document processing, and citizen-centric applications that enhance accessibility and ease of use. By developing homegrown AI models aligned with national objectives, Sarvam AI is reducing reliance on foreign AI systems while strengthening the open-source ecosystem and enabling innovation across startups, academia, research institutions, and industry.\r\n\r\nAn AI model is a computer program trained on vast amounts of data to recognize patterns, make predictions, or generate new content, acting like a digital brain.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSarvam AI\u2019s models include:\r\n\r\nBulbul (Text-to-Speech): Available in 11 Indian languages with 39 distinct speaker voices.\r\nSaaras (Speech-to-Text): Supports all 22 scheduled languages, 8kHz telephony audio, and code-mixed speech.\r\nVision (Document Understanding): Tailored for 22+ Indian languages, mixed scripts, and handwritten text\r\nThrough these foundational capabilities, Sarvam AI demonstrates how India-centric AI can evolve into scalable, resilient, and population-scale digital infrastructure, enhancing public service delivery, improving linguistic accessibility, and reinforcing India\u2019s journey toward a globally competitive AI ecosystem.",
